# Customer-Segmentation-using-K-Mean-Clustering
Objective: Segmented mall customers into distinct groups based on their spending habits and annual income to enable targeted marketing strategies.
Tools & Technologies: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, K-Means Clustering.

# Key Steps:

Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand customer demographics and spending patterns.

Applied feature scaling to normalize the data for clustering.

Utilized the Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters (K=5).

Implemented K-Means clustering to group customers into 5 distinct segments.

Visualized clusters using scatter plots to interpret customer behavior.

# Results: 
Identified high-value customer segments (e.g., high-income, high-spending customers) and provided actionable insights for personalized marketing campaigns.
